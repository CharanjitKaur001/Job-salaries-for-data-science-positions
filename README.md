# Data Science positions Job Salaries

This project looks at the data science job salary data collected by ai-jobs.net. I have performed data analysis in both EXCEL and Python for this project.

I used the following skills to manipulate the data and create the dashboard in Excel:
- Data Cleaning,Removed Duplicates
- Data manipulation. Replaced few location name data having special charaters with proper name using Find and Replace.
- Slicers
- Pivot Tables
- Charting
- Formatting
- Created a dashboard
- The dashboard is completely dynamic and adjusts depending on the location, job_title and experience_level selected via the slicer.
